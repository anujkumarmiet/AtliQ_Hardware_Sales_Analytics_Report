## Market VS Target Report
The report provides an overview of AtliQ Hardware's market performance in various regions from 2019 to 2021. It focuses on the comparison between actual sales and target sales for 2021, highlighting underperformance in multiple regions.

### Key insights from the report:

- **Overall Performance:** The company achieved total sales of 598.9M in 2021, but fell short of the target by 54.9M, representing a 9.2% shortfall.
- **Largest markets:** Key markets like India, the USA, and South Korea contributed significantly to total sales, with India achieving 161.3M, the USA 87.8M, and South Korea 49.0M.
- **Underperformance:** Despite achieving significant sales, most regions missed their targets:
India missed the target by 9.6M (5.9% below target).
USA fell short by 10.2M (11.7% below target).
South Korea underperformed by 4.4M (8.9% below target).
- **High deviation from target:** Markets like Poland (18.1% below target), Canada (14.5% below target), and Spain (14.1% below target) exhibited significant shortfalls.
- **Smaller markets:** Regions like Germany, Indonesia, and Norway also underperformed, missing their targets by 9% to 12%.
## Recommendations:
- **Targeted Strategy for Key Markets:**

Focus on the largest markets (India, USA, South Korea) where the sales volume is significant but targets were missed. These regions are critical for overall revenue and need focused efforts on pricing, marketing, and customer retention.
Revise marketing and sales strategies in underperforming areas by investing in localized campaigns and understanding consumer behavior.

- **Address Underperformance in Specific Regions:**

For regions like Poland, Canada, and Spain, where the gap to target is over 14%, conduct a deeper analysis into the reasons for the shortfall. It could be related to market saturation, product fit, or inadequate marketing efforts.
Consider offering promotions, discounts, or tailored products for these markets to boost demand.

- **Strengthen Supply Chain and Logistics:**

Since the report shows consistent underperformance across most markets, the company should review its supply chain operations. Delays, stock shortages, or inefficiencies in distribution might be causing lower-than-expected sales.
Optimizing the distribution network could help reduce these shortfalls and improve the performance in underperforming markets.

- **Improve Sales Forecasting:**

The 9.2% gap between the actual and target sales suggests potential weaknesses in the company's sales forecasting model. Refine the forecasting techniques to more accurately predict market demand and adjust the targets based on realistic projections.

- **Regional Focused Product Mix:**

Investigate whether the product mix offered in underperforming regions is aligned with local demand. Introducing new products tailored to local preferences or discontinuing less popular ones can help close the performance gap.

#### **By focusing on these strategic areas, AtliQ Hardware can improve its performance against sales targets, close revenue gaps, and ensure a more competitive presence in global markets.**
